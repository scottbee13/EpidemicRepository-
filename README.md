# EpidemicRepository

This is a code repository for a model developed to simulate the diseases percolation between cattle and badgers. 

However saying that, this repository is not designed for public use but rather as a place to save different version of the model and allow my advisor to occasional have a look at it.
Although, if you think that the code could be useful for you, by all means go ahead and have a look. I hope some of it may be useful.
