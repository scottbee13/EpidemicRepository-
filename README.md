# EpidemicRepository

This is a code repository for models developed to simulate the diseases throughout networks. 

However saying that, this repository is not designed for public use but rather as a place to save different version of the model and give others easy access. 

Although, if you think that the code could be useful for you, by all means go ahead and have a look. :D
